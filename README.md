# ShoppingListAngular
A small application I developed using Angular. I referenced: https://www.w3schools.com/angular/angular_application.asp  
And modified the application to calculate the total cost of items on a shopping list, dependent on the quantity of items entered. This is my first application
using the Angular application framework.
